Syntax Guide
============

Before explaining the syntax of Jiko in details, it's important to notice that all Jiko templates are compiled to
JavaScript code. Every syntax element has an equivalent in JavaScript and understanding the resulting code can be
useful.

To ease debugging, Jiko was created to generate a JavaScript code as clean as possible. So you are invited to take a
look at that generated code to precisely understand how Jiko works.

Expression Escaping
-------------------

The most basic task of a template engine is probably to output a variable. Jiko uses the `${}` syntax:

    :::html+mako
    The current time is ${new Date().toString}.

Expressions inside `${}` must simply be any kind of valid JavaScript expression.

Every time the `${}` construct is used, the `escape()` method will be called with the result of the expression
evaluation. `escape()` is a function defined in all Jiko
