Jiko is a modern and easy to use template engine for Javascript. Its objective
is to provide to Javascript programmers a way to write templates with an
engine as powerful as server-side state of the art template engines like
Jinja2 and Mako.

{% syntax "xml+mako" %}
<%
    var array = _.range(1, 11);
%>
<div>
    % _.each(array, function(el) {
    <div>Hello world ${el} times!</div>
    % });
</div>
{% endsyntax %}

Jiko's features:

* Its syntax is as simple and direct as possible. Influenced by well-known
  template engines.
* *Don't reinvent the wheel!* Expressions are pure Javascript.
* Allows multiple templates to be defined in a single template file.
* Compiles templates directly to Javascript to be as fast as possible.
* Allows browser-side on-the-fly compilation for development and server-side
  compilation for production.
* Works in a browser and inside Node.js.
